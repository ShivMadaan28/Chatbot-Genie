1. Salary Structure & Components
Question: What is the difference between CTC, Gross Salary, and Net Salary? 
Answer:

CTC (Cost to Company): The total cost an employer incurs on an employee. It includes Gross Salary + Employer's PF contribution + Gratuity + any other benefits.


Gross Salary: The total salary paid to an employee before any deductions. It includes Basic Salary + Allowances (HRA, LTA, etc.).


Net Salary (Take-Home): The final amount an employee receives in their bank account after all deductions (TDS, Employee PF, Professional Tax, etc.) are subtracted from the Gross Salary.

Question: What is Basic Salary? 
Answer:

This is the fixed, core component of your salary, typically 40-50% of your CTC. It is the basis for calculating other components like Provident Fund (PF), Gratuity, and sometimes HRA.

Question: What is Gross Salary? 
Answer:

Gross Salary is the sum of your Basic Salary and all allowances (like HRA, LTA, Special Allowance) before any tax or other deductions are made.

Question: What is Net Salary or Take-Home Pay? 
Answer:

This is the actual amount credited to your bank account after all deductions (Income Tax/TDS, Employee PF, Professional Tax, ESI) have been subtracted from your Gross Salary.

Question: What does CTC (Cost to Company) include? 
Answer:

CTC includes your Gross Salary, the employer's contribution to your PF account (Employer PF), any performance bonus, gratuity provision, and the cost of any other benefits like health insurance premiums.

Question: What is Dearness Allowance (DA)? 
Answer:

Dearness Allowance is a cost-of-living adjustment allowance paid to employees (primarily government and public sector) to offset the impact of inflation. It is usually calculated as a percentage of the Basic Salary.

Question: What is a "Special Allowance"? 
Answer:

This is typically a residual component of your salary used to "balance" the CTC. It is usually fully taxable and is paid out to meet the promised Gross Salary after all other components (Basic, HRA, etc.) are allocated.

2. Statutory Deductions (PF, ESI, PT)
Question: What is EPF (Employees' Provident Fund)? 
Answer:

EPF is a mandatory retirement savings scheme. Both the employee and the employer contribute 12% of the employee's Basic Salary (plus Dearness Allowance, if any) to this fund.


Question: What is the employee's contribution to PF? 
Answer:

The employee contributes 12% of their Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance. This amount is deducted from the Gross Salary each month to arrive at the Net Salary.

Question: What is the employer's contribution to PF? 
Answer:

The employer also contributes 12%. This amount is split: 8.33% goes to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS) (up to a wage ceiling) and the remaining 3.67% goes to the EPF account. This is part of your CTC but not your Gross Salary.

Question: What is UAN (Universal Account Number)?
Answer:

UAN is a 12-digit number provided by the EPFO (Employees' Provident Fund Organisation). It acts as a single, portable account number for all your PF accounts, allowing you to manage your PF details and transfers easily when you change jobs.

Question: Can I opt out of PF? 
Answer:

If your Basic Salary is above ₹15,000 per month and you are joining your first job (first-time EPF member), you may have the option to opt out. However, if you have been a PF member before, you must continue contributing.

Question: What is ESI (Employees' State Insurance)? 
Answer:

ESI is a social security and health insurance scheme for Indian workers. It provides medical, sickness, maternity, and disability benefits to employees and their families.

Question: Is ESI mandatory for all employees? Answer:

No. It is only mandatory for employees working in ESI-registered companies (generally those with 10+ employees) whose monthly gross salary is ₹21,000 or less.

Question: What is Professional Tax (PT)? 
Answer:

Professional Tax is a small tax on employment levied by the state government (not all states). It is a nominal fixed amount deducted from your salary each month and is based on your salary slab.

3. Allowances and Tax Benefits
Question: What is HRA (House Rent Allowance)? 
Answer:

HRA is an allowance paid by an employer to help employees cover the cost of rented accommodation.

Question: How can I claim tax exemption on HRA? 
Answer:

You can claim tax exemption on HRA if you live in a rented property and submit valid rent receipts to your employer. The exemption is the lowest of the following three:

Actual HRA received.

Actual rent paid minus 10% of Basic Salary.

50% of Basic Salary (for metro cities) or 40% (for non-metro cities).

Question: Do I need my landlord's PAN for HRA exemption? 
Answer:

Yes, you must provide your landlord's PAN if your annual rent payment exceeds ₹1,00,000 (which is ₹8,333 per month).

Question: What is LTA (Leave Travel Allowance)? 
Answer:

LTA is an allowance for travel expenses incurred by an employee (and their family) for a vacation within India. The exemption can be claimed for two journeys in a block of four calendar years.


Question: What expenses are covered under LTA? 
Answer:

LTA covers only the actual travel costs (e.g., air, rail, or bus fare). It does not cover expenses for accommodation, food, or sightseeing.

Question: What is a Flexible Benefit Plan (FBP) or Flexi Basket? 
Answer:

An FBP allows employees to choose from a "menu" of allowances (like food coupons, internet reimbursement, driver salary) up to a certain limit. This helps structure the salary to be more tax-efficient, as many of these components are tax-free upon submitting valid bills.

Question: What are Food Coupons or Meal Vouchers (like Sodexo)? 
Answer:

These are pre-paid vouchers or cards for purchasing food and non-alcoholic beverages. They are tax-exempt up to ₹50 per meal, which typically amounts to ₹2,200 per month (assuming 2 meals a day for 22 working days).

Question: What is Standard Deduction? 
Answer:

This is a flat deduction of ₹50,000 available to all salaried employees. This amount is deducted from your Gross Salary before calculating your taxable income, regardless of your actual expenses.

4. Taxation and Filing
Question: What is TDS (Tax Deducted at Source)? 
Answer:

TDS is the income tax that your employer deducts from your salary every month and pays to the government on your behalf. This is done to pay your tax in installments rather than in a lump sum.

Question: How does my employer calculate my monthly TDS? 
Answer:

Your employer estimates your total annual income, subtracts all your declared deductions (like Section 80C, 80D, HRA, Standard Deduction), calculates the total annual tax, and then divides that tax by 12 to deduct it monthly.

Question: What is "Investment Proof Submission"? 
Answer:

This is a process (usually from January to March) where employees must submit "proofs" (like rent receipts, 80C investment documents, insurance premium receipts) to their employer. This validates the deductions you declared at the start of the year so the employer can calculate your final TDS accurately.

Question: What happens if I don't submit my investment proofs? 
Answer:

If you fail to submit proofs, your employer will assume you made zero tax-saving investments. They will recalculate your tax without those deductions and deduct the remaining tax liability from your salary in the last few months (Jan, Feb, March), leading to a significantly lower take-home pay in those months.

Question: What is Form 16? 
Answer:

Form 16 is an annual certificate issued by your employer (by June 15th). It details the salary you earned and the TDS deducted and paid to the government. It has two parts: Part A (TDS details) and Part B (salary and deduction details).

Question: What is the difference between the Old and New Tax Regime? 
Answer:

Old Regime: Has higher tax slab rates but allows you to claim many deductions and exemptions (like HRA, LTA, Section 80C, 80D).

New Regime: Has lower, more simplified tax slab rates but does not allow you to claim most common deductions (like HRA, LTA, 80C, 80D). The ₹50,000 Standard Deduction is available in both regimes.

Question: Which tax regime is better for me? 
Answer:

It depends on your salary and investments. If you have significant investments (like PF, ELSS, home loan interest, HRA), the Old Regime is often better. If you have few deductions, the New Regime (which is now the default regime) might save you more tax.

Question: What is Section 80C? 
Answer:

Section 80C of the Income Tax Act allows you to reduce your taxable income by up to ₹1,50,000 by investing in specific instruments.

Question: What are common investments under Section 80C? 
Answer:

The most common 80C investments are:

Employees' Provident Fund (EPF)

Public Provident Fund (PPF)

Equity-Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds

Life Insurance Premiums

Tax-saving 5-year Fixed Deposits

Home Loan Principal Repayment

Question: What is Section 80D? 
Answer:

This section provides a tax deduction for premiums paid for health insurance (Mediclaim) for yourself, your family, and your parents.

Question: What is Form 26AS? 
Answer:

Form 26AS is your "tax passbook" or "Annual Tax Statement." It is maintained by the Income Tax Department and shows all taxes paid against your PAN, including TDS deducted by your employer, TDS by banks, and any advance tax you paid.

Question: What is an ITR (Income Tax Return)? 
Answer:

An ITR is a form you file with the Income Tax Department, usually by July 31st. It declares your total income, all deductions, and the total tax you have paid. If you've paid excess tax, you file an ITR to claim a refund.

5. Leave, Bonus, and Gratuity
Question: What is Gratuity? 
Answer:

Gratuity is a lump-sum "thank you" payment given by an employer to an employee for their long-term service.

Question: When am I eligible for Gratuity? 
Answer:

You are eligible to receive gratuity after you have completed five years of continuous service with the same company. It is paid when you leave the company (resign, retire, or are laid off).

Question: How is Gratuity calculated? 
Answer:

The formula for employees covered under the Gratuity Act is: (Last Drawn Salary * 15 / 26) * (Number of Years of Service) Note: "Last Drawn Salary" here means Basic + DA. A "year" is counted as a full year if you've worked for more than 6 months in that year.

Question: What is a Statutory Bonus? 
Answer:

Under the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, companies must pay an annual bonus to employees whose salary (Basic + DA) is ₹21,000 or less. The bonus is calculated on a wage ceiling of ₹7,000 or the minimum wage, whichever is higher.

Question: What is Leave Encashment? 
Answer:

Leave Encashment is the process of receiving money in exchange for unused "Earned Leaves" (EL) or "Privilege Leaves" (PL). This is typically paid out as part of the Full and Final (F&F) settlement when you leave the company.

Question: What is the difference between EL, CL, and SL? 
Answer:

EL (Earned Leave) / PL (Privilege Leave): These are leaves you "earn" by working (e.g., 1.5 days per month). They can be accumulated and often encashed.

CL (Casual Leave): These are for short-term, unforeseen needs. They usually cannot be carried forward to the next year and cannot be encashed.

SL (Sick Leave): These are for medical reasons. They may or may not be carried forward, but they are generally not encashable.

Question: What is LWP (Leave Without Pay)? 
Answer:

LWP is when you take a day off after exhausting all your eligible leaves (EL, CL, SL). For every LWP day, a day's salary is deducted from your monthly pay.

6. Payroll Processes (Joining & Exiting)
Question: What is a Payslip? 
Answer:

A payslip (or salary slip) is a monthly document from your employer that details your total earnings (Basic, HRA, etc.) and all your deductions (TDS, PF, PT, etc.) for that month.

Question: Why is a payslip an important document? 
Answer:

It is a legal proof of your employment and salary. It is required for applying for loans, credit cards, visas, and for filing your income tax return.

Question: What is "Notice Period"? 
Answer:

This is the formal time (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days) that an employee must work after resigning. Similarly, the employer must give the employee the same notice period (or pay) if they terminate their employment.

Question: What is "Notice Period Buyout" or "Shortfall Recovery"? 
Answer:

If you want to leave earlier than your official notice period, your employer may allow you to "buy out" the remaining days. This means they will deduct the salary for the unserved notice period (e.g., 15 days' salary) from your final payment.

Question: What is a "Full and Final" (F&F) Settlement? 
Answer:

This is the last payment processed by an employer when an employee leaves. It includes your salary for the last working month, payment for any unused earned leaves (leave encashment), and any gratuity (if applicable), minus any dues (like notice period shortfall, asset damage, etc.).

Question: When is the F&F settlement paid? 
Answer:

This is typically paid 30 to 45 days after your last working day, once you have completed all exit formalities and clearances.

Question: What is an "Exit Interview"? 
Answer:

An exit interview is a meeting between HR and a departing employee to get feedback on their role, the team, company culture, and their reasons for leaving.

Question: What is a Relieving Letter? 
Answer:

A relieving letter is a formal document issued by your employer on your last working day. It confirms that you have been relieved from your duties and that your resignation has been accepted. It is crucial for joining your next company.
